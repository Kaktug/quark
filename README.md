# Quark 
Personal collection of userChrome &amp; userContent CSS files to trim down Firefox Quantum's bloated UI. Great for power users -- these tweaks remove most UI elements that already have keyboard shortcuts or menu items. 
  
Original styling and inspiration borrowed from user GiantSpeck on Reddit:  
[My Two-Line Firefox Setup - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/7ftsb6/my_twoline_firefox_setup/)
