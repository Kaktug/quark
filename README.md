# Quark
Personal collection of userChrome &amp; userContent CSS files to trim down Firefox Quantum's bloated UI.  
  
Original styling and inspiration borrowed from user GiantSpeck on Reddit:  
[My Two-Line Firefox Setup - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/7ftsb6/my_twoline_firefox_setup/)  
[Original Source](https://pastebin.com/342kbHWd)  
  
## Installation 
1. Create a "Chrome" folder inside your Firefox profile directory  
2. Download and place the userChrome.css file from this repo into the "Chrome" folder
